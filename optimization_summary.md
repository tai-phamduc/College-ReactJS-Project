   - Added validation for critical fields
   - Enhanced security for password handling
   - Optimized indexes for common query patterns
   - Added progressive account lockout mechanism
   - Improved virtual methods for related collections
   - Added pagination to static methods

2. **Movie Model**
   - Optimized schema for better querying
   - Enhanced indexing for performance
   - Improved virtual methods with sorting options
   - Added pagination to static methods
   - Optimized rating update methods
   - Added validation for critical fields

3. **Booking Model**
   - Improved field naming for consistency
   - Enhanced refund handling with detailed tracking
   - Added validation for critical operations
   - Optimized indexes for common query patterns
   - Improved virtual methods for related collections
   - Added pagination to static methods
   - Enhanced check-in validation

## Identified Unused Models

We identified several models that are not directly used in controllers or other files:

1. Cinema.js
2. Country.js
3. EmailTemplate.js
4. Format.js
5. Language.js
6. Menu.js
7. Order.js
8. Product.js
9. Promotion.js
10. Recommendation.js
11. Room.js
12. Screening.js
13. Slider.js
14. Statistics.js
15. UserActivity.js
16. Widget.js
17. AIAnalytics.js

These models are kept for potential future use but could be candidates for removal if they remain unused.

## Recommendations for Further Optimization

1. **Create Controllers for Unused Models**
   - Implement controllers for models like Cinema, Room, and Screening to make use of them
   - Add routes for these controllers in the API

2. **Consolidate Similar Models**
   - Consider merging similar models like EmailTemplate and Notification
   - Combine Widget and Slider into a single UI component model

3. **Add Comprehensive Testing**
   - Create unit tests for model methods
   - Add integration tests for model interactions

4. **Implement Database Indexes**
   - Add appropriate indexes in MongoDB for optimized queries
   - Monitor query performance and adjust indexes as needed

5. **Add Data Validation Middleware**
   - Implement middleware for consistent data validation across models
   - Add sanitization for user inputs

6. **Implement Caching**
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Implement cache invalidation strategies

7. **Optimize Virtuals and References**
   - Review and optimize virtual field definitions
   - Ensure proper population of referenced documents
